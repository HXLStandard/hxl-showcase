There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is strengthening macro-fiscal coordination and budget management, this component will include improved budget credibility associated with a more appropriately developed and managed aggregate fiscal position, delivery by the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED) of predictable funding in accordance with budgets, constrained Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) budgets and control of  the in year position contributing to objectives of platform one, and improved strategic planning and prioritization contributing to objectives of platform two. The second component of the project is reinforcing the control system for improved service delivery, this component include an updated legal framework, robust public procurement practices, tightened payroll controls, strengthened internal audit, improved accounting procedures operating in the MOFED and MDAs and further publication of Public Expenditure Tracking Survey (PETS) contributing to an effective control environment in MDAs. Striving for these internal controls will be reinforced through strengthened scrutiny of public finances by Parliament. The third component of the project is strengthening central finance functions, this component will undertake various cross-cutting activities including IFMIS rollout, all aspects of training and Human Resource (HR) capacity development that are required to support the main Public Financial Management (PFM) functions. The fourth component of the project is assisting non-state actor's oversight, this component will assist the development of the analytic and dissemination capacity of non-state actors in exercising scrutiny of the use of public resources, as well as building a constituency for reform of the PFM system across an array of non-state and government actors. The fifth component of the project is project management, under this component project administration unit will be established within the MOFED and will be staffed with a project manager who will also have monitoring and evaluation responsibilities for the Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Project (IPFMRP), a procurement specialist and a project accountant.",2,16/10/2008,31/07/2014,04/06/2009,31/07/2014,,,,International Development Association,44002,Multilateral,International Development Association,44002,Multilateral,MINISTRY OF FINANCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT,,,SL,Sierra Leone,100,,,,;;;;;15150;,;;;;;Strengthening civil society;,4;20;76;20;80;5;95,OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee;OECD Development Assistance Committee,2,,,C01,5,USD,,4000000,4153702,0,0,0,0,0

At least 60% of the project beneficiaries are expected to be wonen. The project will equip them with business planning, financial management, record keeping and marketing skills accompanied by coaching services and access to credit to implement their individual business plans. The project will be implemented by the existing local staff of the KLSDP supervised by a Small Business Development Officer (SBDO).

While largely welcomed by governments, donors and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank for their contribution to employment, technology and knowledge transfer and economic growth, many civil society actors are concerned about the potential social, economic and environmental impacts of such “land grabbing” on local communities, especially women.  These concerns were confirmed by a study of foreign investments in Sierra Leone’s agricultural sector (Oakland Institute, 2011) that revealed various risks and loopholes in four major land acquisitions. It is for these reasons that land governance has become one of the thematic areas of interventions of ICCO Cooperation’s Sierra Leone program, which is undertaken in close collaboration with other local and international partners, including Christian Aid, Cordaid and several ACT members. ICCO’s project partner, Green Scenery, has built up considerable expertise on land grabbing and other social justice issues. 
Project activities and outputs>> Among other activities, the project is contributing to:

In 2007 a child Rights Act was enacted into law in parliament which promotes and protects the welfare and rights of children, including trafficking. In Sierra Leone, anecdotal evidence indicates that women and children are trafficked internally to Freetown, from neighboring countries and from border towns in Pujehun and Kailahun Districts to neighboring countries like Guinea and Liberia in particular for involuntary domestic servitude, street labor, and commercial sexual exploitation. Children are trafficked from rural areas to Freetown and some from the border towns within Pujehun district to Monrovia with false promises that they will be sent to school, but instead are forced to work on the streets. There have also been reports of trafficking for debt bondage and sexual exploitation in the mines in the interior of Sierra Leonean and Liberia, victims are also trafficked to other West African countries, the Middle East, and Europe. 

In Liberia former government and rebel forces trafficked men, women, and children to serve as porters, laborers, combatant, and sex slaves during the civil war. UNICEF estimates that the former warring factions included more that 15000 children. Armed groups also compelled people to mine gold and diamonds. A significant number of the traffic victims are reported to have returned home through the help of NGOs and UN organizations others are still in Liberia in places like Burmi Hills, where they have the gold mines. The government of Ellen Johnson is yet to make a policy statement on the issue of trafficking and child labor but there are hopes that she will make Liberia a better place.

It is against this background that  RADA, supported by WINROCK worked on a project to raise awareness of the hazards of child labour and child trafficking and the importance of education for children so as to effectively increase awareness and put the necessary community monitoring mechanisms and structures in place to effectively combat child trafficking

This project is therefore develop to build upon the successes of the completed project by strengthening the monitoring mechanism, capacity of communities to address trafficking issues, cross border initiatives and networks and educational placement for children enrolled in the quoranic schools who are in most instances victims of trafficking and child labour.  The project will particularly learn from and build upon the significant achievements of the Borderline Child Trafficking, which reached 123,709 beneficiaries directly and indirectly.

It is expected that 30 community teaches in 4 schools are trained in the hazard of child labor/traficking and are engaged as focal persons to mainstream traficking issues inot their teaching curriculum. In addition, 50 at risk and former traficked children are placed in educational facilities and supported with educational requirements (tuition and fees, learning materials, uniforms, and counseling services).

This project will be partly co-implemented between RADA and the Sustainable Livelihood Promotion Program (SLPP)-RADA's counterpart in Liberia.",2,25/10/2013,30/11/2014,25/10/2013,,,,,KK General,Nl-KvK-30258482,,,,,Rehabilitation and Development Agency in Sierra Leone,,,SL,Sierra Leone,,,,,;,;,60;40,OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes;OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes,3,110,10,B01,5,EUR,EUR,0,30000,0,0,0,0,0

Of the 2.4 million children in the country, 27% are identified as vulnerable. Around 11% is orphaned, having lost one or both parents; 18% of girls are married at age 15; 88.3% have experienced FGM/C; and 81.8% aged 2–14 years have experienced different forms of severe physical punishment. Nationally 18.2% of children in Sierra Leone do not live with biological parents that are alive. Children not living with their parents are more at risk for abuse, violence, neglect and exploitation. Though no reliable data exist, indications are strong that sexual abuse and exploitation is a fact of life for many girls. 

Child protection services have not had the desired impacts on children as they are disjointed, competitive and project based meaning that the resources are ineffectively and inefficiently used. For example even though there are 58 children’s homes or orphanages in the country the provision of interim care for children in need of care and protection has remained one of the most serious gaps in the provision of services for recovery and rehabilitation of child victims of abuse and children in conflict with the law. 

Alleged child offenders are often remanded with adults in prison as there are no alternative care provisions in place for them. Also victims of sexual abuse and violence and trafficking do not have access to safe homes where they can access services for their recovery. The lack of safe homes and other temporary care arrangements also means that victims of sexual abuse have to travel to and from their homes in rural areas to attend court in the district headquarter towns. As they cannot afford the cost of this travel, they will not attend thus hampering the proceedings.

To address the child protection situation in Sierra Leone as a whole and in Bombali, Bo, and Kenema district specifically, it is important to make a strategic shift from a project based approach that focuses on a specific vulnerability within a small category of children to a systems based approach that aims to provide services for the protection of all children. Through a systems based approach: there will be increased awareness about child protection laws and policies; improved coordination and use of resources; government and civil society capacity will be built; sustainability of interventions will be ensured; child protection programming will be more focused and integrated; children’s competencies, voices and participation will be promoted and strengthened; community based mechanisms will be linked to the formal child protection systems and; there will be increased accountability for fulfilling children’s rights.

This project proposals aims to strengthen the child protection system in Bombali, Bo and Kenema district focusing on some of the core elements of systems building; coordination, case management, strengthening of the child protection labor force, putting in place a robust data and information management system, empowering vulnerable families and rehabilitating and reintegrating children at risk.",2,01/11/2013,31/12/2014,01/11/2013,,,,,KK General,Nl-KvK-30258482,,,,,"Defense for Children International, Sierra Leone",,,SL,Sierra Leone,,,,,,,100,OECD Development Assistance Committee 3 digit codes,3,110,10,B01,5,EUR,EUR,0,36554,0,0,0,0,0

WFP aims to support these initiatives through its supplementary feeding and stunting prevention programmes.

Enrolment in primary schools in Sierra Leone has also been a challenge. According to the Government's Millennium Development Goals - Progress Report 2010,net primary school enrolment is between 62 and 69 percent. Gender disparity remains a problem as drop-out rates are high,especially among girls in their early teens. Improving education quality and access to education are a priority under pillar three of the Agenda for Prosperity. WFP aims to support this pillar through its school feeding programme and bridging the gender gap by providing an incentive related to girls' attendance in school and their completion of primary education.

Aligned with WFP Strategic Objectives 2,4 and 5 of WFP's Strategic Results Framework,the Country Programme (CP) focused on increasing access to basic education and promoting human capital development through school feeding,and improving the nutritional status of vulnerable children,pregnant and lactating women and people living with HIV or tuberculosis (TB) through supplementary feeding. In addition,the CP focused on building productive agricultural assets as well as helping to achieve adequate food consumption levels and nutritional status in most food insecure households through asset creation activities. It supported the government in accelerating the transition from recovery to longer-term development. More specifically,WFP's programme portfolio was aligned with the United Nations Joint Vision and supported the government in the implementation of its Agenda for Prosperity (AfP),which is the Poverty Reduction Strategy (2013-2018).

Este proyecto, con vocación de largo plazo, se ha extendido a otras estancias y ámbitos. En concreto, tras la realización de dos foros institucionales y numerosos contactos previos, se arranca un proceso de planificación urbana y territorial para la ciudad de Makeni. El trabajo, desarrollado principalmente por la facultad de Arquitectura del CEU, implica a la Universidad de Makeni, al Ayuntamiento de Makeni y a otras universidades socias en Madrid. La aceleradísima expansión urbana, los importantes déficits en infraestructuras, los retos ambientales y productivos, las carencias en una formación cualificada en planeamiento urbano y la necesidad de dotarse de un marco global para la toma de decisiones, son algunos de los elementos críticos que justifican el proyecto. La facultad de Arquitectura del CEU se ocupa del campo puramente técnico, pero en contacto directo con la Universidad y Ayuntamiento de Makeni. En enero de 2014, Unimak, CEU y Ayuntamiento de Makeni firmaron un documento que, a modo de acuerdo, comprometía la obtención de un Plan Estratégico para Makeni en enero de 2015. El trabajo, pretende sentar las bases del crecimiento futuro de la ciudad y su territorio, anticipando sus principales desafíos y aportando propuestas críticas y operativas desde una aproximación transversal. En paralelo, en un país como Sierra Leona, sin facultades de arquitectura ni de planeamiento urbano, el trabajo que vincula a las Universidades es una oportunidad de generar conocimiento.

The overall objective of the programme is to enable children who are orphans or at the risk of loosing parental care to grow and develop within their natural family environment. These objectives are reached by working with the targeted children families and communities to empower them to effectively protect and care for their children in cooperation with local authorities and service providers.  Focusing on vulnerable children reduces inequality.  Nutrition health education and employment play a key role. The programme emphasizes women's employment opportunities and girl child education.The objectives are attained by programme specific activities. The chosen activities will depend on the needs identified in the family development plan (FDP) of each participating family. There are three types of activities: 1) Direct essential services to support the child's right to survival protection development and participation. 2) Capacity building of caregivers and the community by training and sensitization  so that they are capable and able to protect and care for their children. 3) Advocacy actions aim to improve the overall framework conditions for the children of our target group. At full potential the programme will reach an estimated 1120 children and youth as well as 212 caregivers.,,03/12/2013,31/12/2016,,,,,,Finland,FI,,Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Finland,FI-3,,SOS Children's Villages Sierra Leone,22000,,SL,Sierra Leone,,,,,,,,,1,,,,,EUR,EUR,511518,0,0,0,0,0,0
